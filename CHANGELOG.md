## 6.0.0

##### New Features
- New Renderers:
  - `Aggregated` - Custom renderer for aggregated cells
  - `Pivot` - Custom renderer for Pivoted Cells (utilizes `Expander` and `PivotValue`)
  - `PivotValue` - Custom renderer for Pivot cell values (deprecates the undocumented `pivotRender` option)
  - `Expander` - Custom renderer for Pivot cell Expander
- Pivot Columns are now visibly separate and sorted/filtered independently.
- Custom sorting methods per instance via `defaultSortMethod` and per column via `column.sortMethod`
- Prevent transitions while column resizing for a smoother resize effect.
- You may now use `column.resizable` to restrict or allow resizing for specific columns
- Disable text selection while resizing columns.
- All callbacks can now be utilized without needing to hoist and manage the piece of state they export. That is what their prop counterparts are for, so now the corresponding prop is used instead of the callback to detect a "fully controlled" state.


##### Breaking API Changes
- New Renderers:
  - `Cell` - deprecates and replaces `render`
  - `Header` - deprecates and replaces `header`
  - `Footer` - deprecates and replaces `footer`
  - `Filter`- deprecates and replaces `filterRender`
- Callbacks now provide the destination state as the primary parameter(s). This makes hoisting and controlling the state in redux or component state much easier. eg.
  - `onSorting` no longer requires you to build your own toggle logic
  - `onResize` no longer requires you to build your own resize logic
- The `onChange` callback is now deprecated in favor of the better labeled `onFetchData` prop, which will always fires when a new data model needs to be fetched (or if not using `manual`, when new data is materialized internally).
- The `filtering` prop has been renamed to `filters` for simplicity and consistency.
- The `onFilteringChange` callback has been renamed to `onFilterChange` for simplicity and consistency.
- `cellInfo.row` and `rowInfo.row` now reference the materialize data for the table. To reference the original row, use `cellInfo.original` and `rowInfo.original`
- Removed `pivotRender` column option. You can now control how the value is displayed by overriding the `PivotValueComponent` or the individual column's `PivotValue` renderer.
